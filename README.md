# STAT110/115 Study Materials

A curated set of notes and resources for the University of Otago's **STAT110/115** courses. The repository groups files into folders so tutees can quickly find what they need.

## Repository Structure
- `handouts/` – course handouts in PDF and LaTeX. `new_handout/` contains the latest source; `old_handout/` keeps legacy material including `old_handout.pdf`.
- `lectures/` – 2025 lecture slides.
- `practice_exams/` – past practice exams and solutions.
- `formula_sheet/` – formula summaries for quick reference.
- `scripts/` – helpful scripts, e.g. `r_cheat_sheet.R`.
- `resources/` – extra files such as images or miscellaneous material.

Feel free to download any of the PDFs or adapt the LaTeX sources for personal study.
